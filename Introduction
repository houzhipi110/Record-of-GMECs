Supervisory control in discrete event systems (DES) has
been an active area of research [1][3][4][6][9][11][12].
Many decentralized control approaches have been devel-
oped [1][4][5]. Different approach pocesses its own features.
In Petri Nets (PNs), the compact state representation and
their intrinsical distributed nature may potentially help in
reducing the complexity of decentralized supervisory control
[1][4][5][6][7][8][11]. Therefore, some papers have been
discussed about the design of decentralized supervisors in
PN models [1][4].
