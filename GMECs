Decentralized Supervisory Control of Generalized Mutual Exclusion Constraints in Petri Nets

In this paper, we develop a solution to attain a
set of decentralized monitors based on Generalized Mutual
Exclusion Constraints (GMECs) in the paradigm of a set of
inequalities. These inequalities exhibit cumbersomely complex
and tediously lengthy forms in practice which usually allows
arbitrary constraints. Therefore, a decentralized implemen-
tation of the supervisor can mitigate the amount of agent
communication, eliminate the restriction of space distance,
and decrease the cost of controlled system. In particular, by
removing the limitation that each GMECs is a singleton, our
method can accommodate three or more independent variables.
Our solution derives from geometrical space analysis as well as
linear programming formulation.
